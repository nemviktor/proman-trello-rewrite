## Story

### An email from the client

```
From: Mark Big <ceo@thepartner.com>

Subject: Welcome on board for the ProMan project!

In these days everyone wants to create a new project management tool,
and we're no exception either. We'd like to implement
something similar to Trello, so we can say we have our own tool!

We call it: ProMan

It's your job to finish the project!

Remember, we need completed user stories and quality work!

```

The client imagines the app as a "one pager" where all
the boards are displayed, and when one is opened then the corresponding cards are shown.

Of course, the customer would love to have an application which is easy to use at first
glance, functionality is straightforward and looks nice on different screen sizes if possible.
Let's get this job done.
